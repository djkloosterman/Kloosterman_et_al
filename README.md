# Kloosterman_et_al

This repository contains the metadata necessary for the analysis of the scRNA-seq, VISIUM and other datasets generated and presented in Kloosterman, D.J., Erbani, J., et al. Cell, in revision (2024): _Aberrant myelin-recycling steers lipid-laden macrophage formation in the glioblastoma microenvironment to fuel malignancy_.

# Downloading the data

This repository contains the scripts needed to reproduce the figures from this manuscript that were generated with R. In addition, we added several other large datasets that were used to generate figures outside of R, and will therefore have no scripts to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.

We provide access to following datasets with scripts to reproduce the figures in the manuscript:
  - scRNA-seq on sorted CD45-/CD45+ cells (50:50) from primary and recurrent glioblastoma GEMMs with either a PDG-Ink4 or PDG-shp53 background
  - VISIUM 10x samples of primary and recurrent glioblastoma GEMMs with either a PDG-Ink4 or PDG-shp53 background
  - RNAseq on sorted lipid-laden and non-lipid-laden microglia (MG) and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) from primary PDG-Ink4a tumors
  - ATACseq on sorted lipid-laden and non-lipid-laden microglia (MG) and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) from primary and recurrent PDG-Ink4a tumors
  - RNAseq on sorted dTom+ macrophages from an ex vivo tumor assay, which are either exposed to the full tumor, a tumor without myelin, myelin alone, or nothing
  - RNAseq, lipidomics and proteomics data of sorted MES-like tumor cells and macrophages from several mono- and co-culture conditions in the presence or absence of myelin

We provide access to following datasets:
  - Lipidomics on sorted lipid-laden and non-lipid-laden TAMs (MG and MDMs combined) from primary PDG-Ink4a tumors (broad and cholesterol focussed)
  - Lipidomics on tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) from non-tumor bearing brain, primary and recurrent PDG-Ink4a tumors
  - Lipidomics and proteomics on myelin isolated from non-tumor bearing brain, primary and recurrent PDG-Ink4a tumors
